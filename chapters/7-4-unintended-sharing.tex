\subsection{Unintended Sharing}

This happens when state is shared between processes unintentionally.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example of unintended sharing.}]
void inc() {
  static int local = 0;
  local += 1;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Since the \texttt{static} keyword is used the variable \texttt{local} will be kept among runs of the \texttt{inc} function,
it also has the effect that the variable will be shared by threads running the same function.
