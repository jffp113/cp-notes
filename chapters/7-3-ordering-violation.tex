\section{Ordering Violation}

Missing or incorrect synchronization between two processes.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Simple Producer, running on Thread $1$}]
work = null;
LaunchThread(new Thread(2));
work = new Work();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Simple Consumer, running on Thread $2$}]
ConsumeWork(work);
\end{lstlisting}

It is possible for work to be consumed before it was initialized,
thus the correct operation ordering for Thread $1$ would be the following.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Simple Correct Producer, running on Thread $1$}]
work = new Work();
LaunchThread(new Thread(2));
\end{lstlisting}
